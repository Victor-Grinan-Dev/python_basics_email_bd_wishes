# 1. Update the birthdays.csv with your friends & family's details.
# HINT: Make sure one of the entries matches today's date for testing purposes. e.g.
# name,email,year,month,day
def update_test():
    my_bd = datetime.date.today()
    with open('birthdays.csv', 'r') as file:
        data = file.readlines()
        pd_data = pd.read_csv('birthdays.csv')
        print(pd_data)
        # for dat in data:
        #     print(dat)


update_test()
# YourName,your_own@email.com,today_year,today_month,today_day

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Create a tuple from today's month and day using datetime. e.g.
# today = (today_month, today_day)

# HINT 2: Use pandas to read the birthdays.csv

# HINT 3: Use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary from birthday.csv that is formated like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (birthday_month, birthday_day): data_row
# }
# Dictionary comprehension template for pandas DataFrame looks like this:
# new_dict = {new_key: new_value for (index, data_row) in data.iterrows()}
# e.g. if the birthdays.csv looked like this:
# name,email,year,month,day
# Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
# Then the birthdays_dict should look like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (12, 24): Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
# }

# HINT 4: Then you could compare and see if today's month/day tuple matches one of the keys in birthday_dict like this:
# if (today_month, today_day) in birthdays_dict:

# 3. If there is a match, pick a random letter (letter_1.txt/letter_2.txt/letter_3.txt) from letter_templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Think about the relative file path to open each letter.
# HINT 2: Use the random module to get a number between 1-3 to pick a randome letter.
# HINT 3: Use the replace() method to replace [NAME] with the actual name. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp

# 4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.
# HINT 1: Gmail(smtp.gmail.com), Yahoo(smtp.mail.yahoo.com), Hotmail(smtp.live.com), Outlook(smtp-mail.outlook.com)
# HINT 2: Remember to call .starttls()
# HINT 3: Remember to login to your email service with email/password. Make sure your security setting is set to allow less secure apps.
# HINT 4: The message should have the Subject: Happy Birthday then after \n\n The Message Body.

## Working with date and time in Python
# import datetime as dt

# now = dt.datetime.now()
# year = now.year
# month = now.month
# day_of_week = now.weekday()
# print(day_of_week)

# date_of_birth = dt.datetime(year=1995, month=12, day=15, hour=4)
# print(date_of_birth)
